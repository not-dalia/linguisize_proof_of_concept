The words\n  in these introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes,\n  and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and\n  spray; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly\n  moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.\n  </p>",

I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my\n  own uncle—my mother’s brother—that he had taken me when a parentless infant to\n  his house; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of Mrs. Reed\n  that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children. Mrs. Reed\n  probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had, I dare say, as\n  well as her nature would permit her; but how could she really like an\n  interloper not of her race, and unconnected with her, after her husband’s\n  death, by any tie? It must have been most irksome to find herself bound by a\n  hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a parent to a strange child she\n  could not love, and to see an uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her own\n  family group.\n  </p>"

I doubted not—never doubted—that if Mr. Reed\n  had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I sat looking at\n  the white bed and overshadowed walls—occasionally also turning a fascinated eye\n  towards the dimly gleaming mirror—I began to recall what I had heard of dead\n  men, troubled in their graves by the violation of their last wishes, revisiting\n  the earth to punish the perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr.\n  Reed’s spirit, harassed by the wrongs of his sister’s child, might quit its\n  abode—whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the departed—and\n  rise before me in this chamber. I wiped my tears and hushed my sobs, fearful\n  lest any sign of violent grief might waken a preternatural voice to comfort me,\n  or elicit from the gloom some haloed face, bending over me with strange pity.\n  This idea, consolatory in theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with\n  all my might I endeavoured to stifle it—I endeavoured to be firm. Shaking my\n  hair from my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark\n  room; at this moment a light gleamed on the wall. Was it, I asked myself, a ray\n  from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind? No; moonlight was still,\n  and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling and quivered over\n  my head. I can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was, in all\n  likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn: but\n  then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken as my nerves were by\n  agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some coming vision\n  from another world. My heart beat thick, my head grew hot; a sound filled my\n  ears, which I deemed the rushing of wings; something seemed near me; I was\n  oppressed, suffocated: endurance broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the\n  lock in desperate effort.

This book I had again and again perused with delight. I considered it\n  a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of interest deeper than what\n  I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves, having sought them in vain among\n  foxglove leaves and bells, under mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling\n  old wall-nooks, I had at length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they\n  were all gone out of England to some savage country where the woods were wilder\n  and thicker, and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag\n  being, in my creed, solid parts of the earth’s surface, I doubted not that I\n  might one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little fields,\n  houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds of\n  the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs, the\n  monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other. Yet, when this\n  cherished volume was now placed in my hand—when I turned over its leaves, and\n  sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now, never failed to\n  find—all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt goblins, the pigmies\n  malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most desolate wanderer in most dread\n  and dangerous regions.

She boasted of beautiful paintings of\n  landscapes and flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces\n  they could play, of purses they could net, of French books they could\n  translate; till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened.

Christmas and the New Year\n  had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer; presents had\n  been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given. From every enjoyment I\n  was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the\n  daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and seeing them descend to the\n  drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair\n  elaborately ringletted; and afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano\n  or the harp played below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman,\n  to the jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken\n  hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed. When tired of\n  this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the solitary and silent\n  nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not miserable. To speak truth, I had\n  not the least wish to go into company, for in company I was very rarely\n  noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind and companionable, I should have\n  deemed it a treat to spend the evenings quietly with her, instead of passing\n  them under the formidable eye of Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and\n  gentlemen. But Bessie, as soon as she had dressed her young ladies, used to\n  take herself off to the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper’s room,\n  generally bearing the candle along with her. I then sat with my doll on my knee\n  till the fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing\n  worse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull\n  red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might, and\n  sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib. To this crib I always took my\n  doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth of worthier objects\n  of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded\n  graven image, shabby as a miniature scarecrow. It puzzles me now to remember\n  with what absurd sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive\n  and capable of sensation. I could not sleep unless it was folded in my\n  night-gown; and when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy,\n  believing it to be happy likewise.\n  </p>"

Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural\n  capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of\n  narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her nursery\n  tales. She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face and person are\n  correct. I remember her as a slim young woman, with black hair, dark eyes, very\n  nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she had a capricious and hasty\n  temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or justice: still, such as she was,\n  I preferred her to any one else at Gateshead Hall.\n  </p>",

She had a\n  turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for saving; shown not only in the\n  vending of eggs and chickens, but also in driving hard bargains with the\n  gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and slips of plants; that functionary\n  having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of his young lady all the products of her\n  parterre she wished to sell: and Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if\n  she could have made a handsome profit thereby. As to her money, she first\n  secreted it in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of\n  these hoards having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day\n  losing her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a\n  usurious rate of interest—fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted\n  every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy.\n  </p>"

Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure they do not see it—her\n  sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart: she is looking at what she can\n  remember, I believe; not at what is really present.

Mrs. Fairfax! I saw her in a black gown and widow’s cap; frigid, perhaps,\n  but not uncivil: a model of elderly English respectability. Thornfield! that,\n  doubtless, was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I\n  failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises. Millcote,\n  ——shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England; yes, I saw it;\n  both the shire and the town. ——shire was seventy miles nearer London than the\n  remote county where I now resided: that was a recommendation to me. I longed to\n  go where there was life and movement: Millcote was a large manufacturing town\n  on the banks of the A——: a busy place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it\n  would be a complete change at least. Not that my fancy was much captivated by\n  the idea of long chimneys and clouds of smoke—“but,” I argued, “Thornfield\n  will, probably, be a good way from the town.”\n  </p>"

No feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing.

She had no great talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar\n  development of feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary\n  level of childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her\n  below it. She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious, though\n  perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay prattle, and\n  efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of attachment\n  sufficient to make us both content in each other’s society.\n  </p>"

No,—I exaggerate; I never thought there\n  was any consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort of pastille perfume\n  she had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an odour of sanctity. I was just\n  beginning to stifle with the fumes of conservatory flowers and sprinkled\n  essences, when I bethought myself to open the window and step out on to the\n  balcony. It was moonlight and gaslight besides, and very still and serene.

Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to give information\n  respecting the resources of the house in shawls, dresses, draperies of any\n  kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey were ransacked, and their\n  contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped petticoats, satin sacques, black\n  modes, lace lappets, &amp;c., were brought down in armfuls by the abigails;\n  then a selection was made, and such things as were chosen were carried to the\n  boudoir within the drawing-room.\n  </p>"

Somebody, unseen, rang the bell merrily; then Adèle (who had\n  insisted on being one of her guardian’s party), bounded forward, scattering\n  round her the contents of a basket of flowers she carried on her arm. Then\n  appeared the magnificent figure of Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on\n  her head, and a wreath of roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr.\n  Rochester, and together they drew near the table. They knelt; while Mrs. Dent\n  and Louisa Eshton, dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them.

The drawing-room, as\n  I have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining-room, and on the\n  top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within the room, appeared a\n  large marble basin, which I recognised as an ornament of the conservatory—where\n  it usually stood, surrounded by exotics, and tenanted by gold fish—and whence\n  it must have been transported with some trouble, on account of its size and\n  weight.\n  </p>",

Presently advanced into\n  view Miss Ingram. She, too, was attired in oriental fashion: a crimson scarf\n  tied sash-like round the waist: an embroidered handkerchief knotted about her\n  temples; her beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of\n  supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head. Both her cast of form and\n  feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea of some\n  Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was doubtless the\n  character she intended to represent.\n  </p>",

I could not unlove him, because I\n  felt sure he would soon marry this very lady—because I read daily in her a\n  proud security in his intentions respecting her—because I witnessed hourly in\n  him a style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought\n  than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its very\n  pride, irresistible.\n  </p>",

Much too, you will think, reader, to engender jealousy: if a\n  woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a woman in Miss Ingram’s.\n  But I was not jealous: or very rarely;—the nature of the pain I suffered could\n  not be explained by that word. Miss Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was\n  too inferior to excite the feeling. Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I\n  say. She was very showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many\n  brilliant attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature:\n  nothing bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted\n  by its freshness. She was not good; she was not original: she used to repeat\n  sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an opinion of her own.\n  She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did not know the sensations of\n  sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were not in her. Too often she betrayed\n  this, by the undue vent she gave to a spiteful antipathy she had conceived\n  against little Adèle: pushing her away with some contumelious epithet if she\n  happened to approach her; sometimes ordering her from the room, and always\n  treating her with coldness and acrimony. Other eyes besides mine watched these\n  manifestations of character—watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly. Yes; the\n  future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended a\n  ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity—this guardedness of\n  his—this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one’s defects—this obvious\n  absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever-torturing pain\n  arose.\n  </p>"

All their\n  class held these principles: I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding\n  them such as I could not fathom. It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like\n  him, I would take to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very\n  obviousness of the advantages to the husband’s own happiness offered by this\n  plan convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of\n  which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world would act as I\n  wished to act.\n  </p>"

The sarcasm that had repelled, the harshness that\n  had startled me once, were only like keen condiments in a choice dish: their\n  presence was pungent, but their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid.\n  And as for the vague something—was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or\n  a desponding expression?—that opened upon a careful observer, now and then, in\n  his eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange depth partially\n  disclosed; that something which used to make me fear and shrink, as if I had\n  been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and had suddenly felt the ground\n  quiver and seen it gape: that something, I, at intervals, beheld still; and\n  with throbbing heart, but not with palsied nerves. Instead of wishing to shun,\n  I longed only to dare—to divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because\n  one day she might look into the abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets and\n  analyse their nature.\n  </p>",

Mild Mrs. Dent talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two\n  sometimes bestowed a courteous word or smile on me. Sir George Lynn, Colonel\n  Dent, and Mr. Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice\n  business. Lord Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and\n  with one of the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant\n  speeches of the other. Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended their\n  by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after all, Mr.\n  Rochester and—because closely connected with him—Miss Ingram were the life and\n  soul of the party.

Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed\n  I was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for my\n  present conduct at some period fast coming.

I shut the closet to\n  conceal the strange, wraith-like apparel it contained; which, at this evening\n  hour—nine o’clock—gave out certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow\n  of my apartment. “I will leave you by yourself, white dream,” I said. “I am\n  feverish: I hear the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it.”\n  </p>"

I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous haste, eager to\n  catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled from under my feet,\n  the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung round my neck in terror,\n  and almost strangled me; at last I gained the summit. I saw you like a speck on\n  a white track, lessening every moment. The blast blew so strong I could not\n  stand. I sat down on the narrow ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap:\n  you turned an angle of the road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall\n  crumbled; I was shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell,\n  and woke.”\n  </p>"

Cheer up, Dick!—never fear me!—I’d almost as\n  soon strike a woman as you. Bertha Mason is mad; and she came of a mad family;\n  idiots and maniacs through three generations!

A vision, as it seemed to me,\n  had risen at his side.

Perfect beauty\n  is a strong expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet features\n  as ever the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as\n  ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified, in\n  this instance, the term. No charm was wanting, no defect was perceptible; the\n  young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes shaped and coloured as we\n  see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark, and full; the long and shadowy\n  eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so soft a fascination; the pencilled\n  brow which gives such clearness; the white smooth forehead, which adds such\n  repose to the livelier beauties of tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and\n  smooth; the lips, fresh too, ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and\n  gleaming teeth without flaw; the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich,\n  plenteous tresses—all advantages, in short, which, combined, realise the ideal\n  of beauty, were fully hers. I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I\n  admired her with my whole heart. Nature had surely formed her in a partial\n  mood; and, forgetting her usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed\n  this, her darling, with a grand-dame’s bounty.\n  </p>"

Some time elapsed before, with all my\n  efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature. Wholly untaught, with\n  faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me hopelessly dull; and, at first sight,\n  all dull alike: but I soon found I was mistaken. There was a difference amongst\n  them as amongst the educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this\n  difference rapidly developed itself. Their amazement at me, my language, my\n  rules, and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping\n  rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough. Many showed themselves\n  obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few examples of\n  natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of excellent capacity,\n  that won both my goodwill and my admiration. These soon took a pleasure in\n  doing their work well, in keeping their persons neat, in learning their tasks\n  regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly manners. The rapidity of their\n  progress, in some instances, was even surprising; and an honest and happy pride\n  I took in it: besides, I began personally to like some of the best girls; and\n  they liked me. I had amongst my scholars several farmers’ daughters: young\n  women grown, almost. These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I\n  taught the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of\n  needlework. I found estimable characters amongst them—characters desirous of\n  information and disposed for improvement—with whom I passed many a pleasant\n  evening hour in their own homes. Their parents then (the farmer and his wife)\n  loaded me with attentions. There was an enjoyment in accepting their simple\n  kindness, and in repaying it by a consideration—a scrupulous regard to their\n  feelings—to which they were not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which\n  both charmed and benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own\n  eyes, it made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.\n  </p>"

I now closed Morton school, taking care that the parting\n  should not be barren on my side. Good fortune opens the hand as well as the\n  heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely received, is but\n  to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the sensations. I had long felt\n  with pleasure that many of my rustic scholars liked me, and when we parted,\n  that consciousness was confirmed: they manifested their affection plainly and\n  strongly. Deep was my gratification to find I had really a place in their\n  unsophisticated hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future\n  that I did not visit them, and give them an hour’s teaching in their school.\n  </p>"

And that is saying a great deal; for after\n  all, the British peasantry are the best taught, best mannered, most\n  self-respecting of any in Europe: since those days I have seen paysannes and\n  Bäuerinnen; and the best of them seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and\n  besotted, compared with my Morton girls.\n  </p>",

              "<p>\n  Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was\n  charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned\n  topsy-turvy—how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook. And really, after\n  a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was delightful by degrees to\n  invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made. I had previously taken a\n  journey to S—— to purchase some new furniture: my cousins having given me\n  <i>carte blanche</i> to effect what alterations I pleased, and a sum having\n  been set aside for that purpose. The ordinary sitting-room and bedrooms I left\n  much as they were: for I knew Diana and Mary would derive more pleasure from\n  seeing again the old homely tables, and chairs, and beds, than from the\n  spectacle of the smartest innovations. Still some novelty was necessary, to\n  give to their return the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested. Dark\n  handsome new carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected\n  antique ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and\n  dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked fresh\n  without being glaring. A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished entirely, with\n  old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the passage, and carpets\n  on the stairs. When all was finished, I thought Moor House as complete a model\n  of bright modest snugness within, as it was, at this season, a specimen of\n  wintry waste and desert dreariness without.\n  </p>"

I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the house\n  till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the commotion, at\n  once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed to scare him to\n  estrangement. He found me in the kitchen, watching the progress of certain\n  cakes for tea, then baking. Approaching the hearth, he asked, “If I was at last\n  satisfied with housemaid’s work?” I answered by inviting him to accompany me on\n  a general inspection of the result of my labours. With some difficulty, I got\n  him to make the tour of the house. He just looked in at the doors I opened; and\n  when he had wandered upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through\n  a great deal of fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes\n  in so short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the\n  improved aspect of his abode.\n  </p>",

              "<p>\n  Now, I did not like this, reader. St. John was a good man; but I began to feel\n  he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold. The\n  humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him—its peaceful\n  enjoyments no charm. Literally, he lived only to aspire—after what was good and\n  great, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor approve of others resting\n  round him. As I looked at his lofty forehead, still and pale as a white\n  stone—at his fine lineaments fixed in study—I comprehended all at once that he\n  would hardly make a good husband: that it would be a trying thing to be his\n  wife. I understood, as by inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver;\n  I agreed with him that it was but a love of the senses. I comprehended how he\n  should despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he\n  should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever\n  conducting permanently to his happiness or hers. I saw he was of the material\n  from which nature hews her heroes—Christian and Pagan—her lawgivers, her\n  statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great interests to rest\n  upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous column, gloomy and out of\n  place.\n  </p>",
              "<p>\n  “This parlour is not his sphere,” I reflected: “the Himalayan ridge or Caffre\n  bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him better. Well may\n  he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his element: there his faculties\n  stagnate—they cannot develop or appear to advantage. It is in scenes of strife\n  and danger—where courage is proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude\n  tasked—that he will speak and move, the leader and superior. A merry child\n  would have the advantage of him on this hearth. He is right to choose a\n  missionary’s career—I see it now.”\n  </p>"

It was now dark;\n  but a rumbling of wheels was audible. Hannah soon had a lantern lit. The\n  vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened the door: first one\n  well-known form, then another, stepped out. In a minute I had my face under\n  their bonnets, in contact first with Mary’s soft cheek, then with Diana’s\n  flowing curls. They laughed—kissed me—then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half\n  wild with delight; asked eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the\n  affirmative, hastened into the house.\n  </p>",

While the driver and Hannah brought in the boxes, they\n  demanded St. John. At this moment he advanced from the parlour. They both threw\n  their arms round his neck at once. He gave each one quiet kiss, said in a low\n  tone a few words of welcome, stood a while to be talked to, and then,\n  intimating that he supposed they would soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew\n  there as to a place of refuge.\n  </p>",

The event of the day—that is, the return of Diana\n  and Mary—pleased him; but the accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult,\n  the garrulous glee of reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow\n  was come. In the very meridian of the night’s enjoyment, about an hour after\n  tea, a rap was heard at the door.

Besides, I was out of\n  practice in talking to him: his reserve was again frozen over, and my frankness\n  was congealed beneath it. He had not kept his promise of treating me like his\n  sisters; he continually made little chilling differences between us, which did\n  not at all tend to the development of cordiality: in short, now that I was\n  acknowledged his kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I felt the\n  distance between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the\n  village schoolmistress.

I found the rules of the\n  establishment were too strict, its course of study too severe for a child of\n  her age: I took her home with me. I meant to become her governess once more,\n  but I soon found this impracticable; my time and cares were now required by\n  another—my husband needed them all. So I sought out a school conducted on a\n  more indulgent system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and\n  bringing her home sometimes. I took care she should never want for anything\n  that could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode, became\n  very happy there, and made fair progress in her studies. As she grew up, a\n  sound English education corrected in a great measure her French defects; and\n  when she left school, I found in her a pleasing and obliging companion: docile,\n  good-tempered, and well-principled.

              "<p>\n  I have now been married ten years. I know what it is to live entirely for and\n  with what I love best on earth. I hold myself supremely blest—blest beyond what\n  language can express; because I am my husband’s life as fully as he is mine. No\n  woman was ever nearer to her mate than I am: ever more absolutely bone of his\n  bone and flesh of his flesh. I know no weariness of my Edward’s society: he\n  knows none of mine, any more than we each do of the pulsation of the heart that\n  beats in our separate bosoms; consequently, we are ever together. To be\n  together is for us to be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company.\n  We talk, I believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated\n  and an audible thinking. All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his\n  confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character—perfect\n  concord is the result.\n  </p>",
              "<p>\n  Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps it was\n  that circumstance that drew us so very near—that knit us so very close: for I\n  was then his vision, as I am still his right hand. Literally, I was (what he\n  often called me) the apple of his eye. He saw nature—he saw books through me;\n  and never did I weary of gazing for his behalf, and of putting into words the\n  effect of field, tree, town, river, cloud, sunbeam—of the landscape before us;\n  of the weather round us—and impressing by sound on his ear what light could no\n  longer stamp on his eye. Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary\n  of conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished to be\n  done. And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most exquisite, even\n  though sad—because he claimed these services without painful shame or damping\n  humiliation. He loved me so truly, that he knew no reluctance in profiting by\n  my attendance: he felt I loved him so fondly, that to yield that attendance was\n  to indulge my sweetest wishes.\n  </p>"
